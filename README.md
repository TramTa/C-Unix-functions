# C-Unix-utilities

Course work:

Implement several Unix function utilities. 

- reverse: read in the data from the specified input file and reverse it

- wcat: reads a file and prints its contents

- wgrep: looks through a file and find a user-specified search term. If a line has the word within it, the line is printed out

- wzip and wunzip: simple file compression and file decompression tools. Compression is done with run-length encoding (RLE)
